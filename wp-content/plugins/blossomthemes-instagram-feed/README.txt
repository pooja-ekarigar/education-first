Show instagram feed on your website using shortcode and widget.

== Description ==

BlossomThemes Instagram Feed plugin is a flexible Instagram plugin that allows you to show your Instagram profile on your website. The plugin works best with BlossonThemes’ themes.

You can display up to 20 photos with maximum 5 photos in each row. 

The plugin generates shortcode and widget. So, you can show your Instagram feed either inside your posts and/or on the sidebars.

The plugin is very easy to use. 

Generating your Instagram Shortcode:

Once activated, a menu named “BlossomThemes Instagram Feed” will be created on the WordPress dashboard. 

Go to BlossomThemes Instagram Feed. Then, on the General tab, enter your Instagram username, select number of photos to display (max. 20), select number of photos per row (max. 5 photos per row), select whether to enable or disable comments and likes and then click on “Save Changes”.

Then, go to Usage tab, copy the shortcode and use it on your posts. As easy as that!

Using Widget:

The plugin will create a widget called “BlossomThemes: Instagram”. So, go to Appearance> Widgets on your Admin dashboard, select the BlossomThemes: Instagram widget and place it in the desired sidebar. 

If you do not enter the Instagram username in the widget, the username assigned on the main plugin page (on BlossomThemes Instagram Feed) will be used.

== Installation ==
**From your WordPress dashboard**

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New',
2. Search for 'BlossomThemes Instagram Feed' and install the plugin.
3. Activate ‘BlossomThemes Instagram Feed’ from your Plugins page.
